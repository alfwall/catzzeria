- [ ] Have an Elevator Pitch (A one-minute description of your application)
- [ ] Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
- [ ] Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
- [ ] Demo: Show your stuff!
- [ ] Directions for future development.
- [ ] Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository.

    - [ ] Change the name of the repo and any references to LANTA if is changed. 
- [x] Create skeleton of project, folder structure with js and css and images in subfolders.
- [ ] "Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap."
    - [ ] Brainstorm some options? I don't recall any offhand.
- [ ] "Be interactive (i.e.: accept and respond to user input)."

- [ ] "Include at least one modal, and does NOT use native browser alert, confirm, or prompt functionality."
- [ ] "Use client-side storage to store persistent data."
- [ ] "Be responsive." (Window size stuff, design for mobile devices first)
- [ ] "Have a polished UI."
- [ ] "Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.)."
- [ ] Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
- [ ] ALL OF US put a link to it in our portfolio project pages (from module 2).


## User Story
AS A user on the internet,
I WANT to play a silly game
SO THAT I can be entertained by funny cats making pizzas.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN that I've not played before,

WHEN I first open the page,
THEN I see a big pizza button and the number 0 next to the word "pizza slices".

WHEN I click the big pizza button,
THEN the number goes up.

WHEN the number reaches 10,
THEN a new button appears with the phrase "hire a cat".

WHEN I press the "hire a cat" button,
THEN the pizza slices number subtracts by 10, and a new number appears next to the word "cats".

WHEN I have any cats hired,
THEN my pizza slice number goes up automatically every 1 second.

WHEN I try to press the "hire a cat" button without enough pizza slices,
THEN the button doesn't click.

WHEN I successfully hire a cat,
THEN the price of hiring cats goes up some amount.
