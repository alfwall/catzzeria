- [ ] Have an Elevator Pitch (A one-minute description of your application)
- [ ] Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

- [ ] Demo: Show your stuff!
- [ ] Directions for future development.
- [ ] Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository.

- [ ] "Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap."
    - [ ] Brainstorm some options? I don't recall any offhand.
- [ ] "Be interactive (i.e.: accept and respond to user input)."
- [ ] "Use at least 2 server-side API's."
- [ ] "Include at least one modal, and does NOT use native browser alert, confirm, or prompt functionality."
- [ ] "Use client-side storage to store persistent data."

- [ ] "Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.)."
