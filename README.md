# Team Lanta presents: Catzzeria!

## Description
Welcome to the Catzzeria! In this game, you will be able to increase your Pizza Slices count with clicks initially. Once you meet the first requirement to hiring your very first cat with 10 slices of pizza, you have your first handy dandy employee that will help increase your pizza count! Moving forward, the Pizza Slices needed to hire more cats will increase every time, but each cat will help increase productivity. 

Users are also able to get the weather in Rome, Italy and check the stock price for Domino's pizza while they try to hire more cats! 

## Features
* Weather forecast in Rome, Italy - one of the best places in the world to get pizza! 
* Thinking of buying some stock anytime soon? Check out the stock price for Domino's pizza while you gather some pizza slices to hire some cats!
* Save your progress!

## User Story
AS A user on the internet,
I WANT to play a silly game
SO THAT I can be entertained by funny cats making pizzas.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN that I've not played before,

WHEN I first open the page,
THEN I see a big pizza button and the number 0 next to the word "pizza slices".

WHEN I click the big pizza button,
THEN the number goes up.

WHEN the number reaches 10,
THEN a new button appears with the phrase "hire a cat".

WHEN I press the "hire a cat" button,
THEN the pizza slices number subtracts by 10, and a new number appears next to the word "cats".

WHEN I have any cats hired,
THEN my pizza slice number goes up automatically every 1 second.

WHEN I try to press the "hire a cat" button without enough pizza slices,
THEN the button doesn't click.

WHEN I successfully hire a cat,
THEN the price of hiring cats goes up some amount.
